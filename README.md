# Install-Security-Cameras-at-Traffic-Intersections
## Abstract -
The purpose of the project is to help the Police Department install security cameras at traffic intersections. The police department needs to minimize the number of cameras they need to install and cover all streets effectively. While working on this project we found that this project is based on finding a minimum vertex cover along with some approximation algorithm. To help the police we have implemented the minimum vertex cover and two approx algorithms based on vertex cover. The minimum vertex cover is a polynomial time reduction of a CNF-SAT problem that we are naming as CNF-SAT-VC algorithm and the other two approx algorithms are named as APPROX-VC-1 and APPROX-VC-2.

## Introduction -
The minimum vertex cover is an NP-complete problem and an optimization problem that can be solved in polynomial time with P = NP conjecture is substantiated. The minimum vertex cover is an optimization problem that can be solved in polynomial time, making it an NP-complete problem. A vertex cover is an undirected graph G = {V, E} (where V is vertices and E is edges) is a subset C in V vertices such that for every edge {u, v} of the graph, either {u} or {v} is in the vertex cover.
